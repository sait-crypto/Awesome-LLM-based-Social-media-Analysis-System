Controversial content refers to content that attracts different opinions and interrogations, implying interaction between communities. Its automatic identification remains a challenging task. Most of the existing approaches rely on the graph structure of discussion and/or the content of messages but did not deeply explore the recent advances on Graph Neural Network (gnn) to predict if a discussion is controversial or not.

This design encodes complex network information and individual stances into a unified feature space.

With social bots evolving continually, they primarily evade detection by imitating human features and engaging in interactions with humans. To reduce the impact of social bots imitating human features, also known as feature camouflage, existing methods mainly utilize multi-modal user information for detection, especially GNN-based methods that utilize additional topological structure information. However, these methods ignore relation camouflage, which involves disguising through interactions with humans. We find that relation camouflage results in both homophilic connections formed by nodes of the same type and heterophilic connections formed by nodes of different types in social networks. The existing GNN-based detection methods assume all connections are homophilic while ignoring the difference among neighbors in heterophilic connections, which leads to a poor detection performance for bots with relation camouflage. To address this, we propose a multi-modal social bot detection method with learning homophilic and heterophilic connections adaptively (BothH for short).

However, these methods face challenges when detecting advanced bots interacting with genuine accounts. Interaction with real accounts results in the graph structure containing camouflaged and unreliable edges.

A key issue on social news websites is the formation of low-credibility communities, which often lead to the spread of highly biased or uncredible news. We develop a method to identify communities prone to uncredible or highly biased news within a social news website. We employ a user embedding pipeline that detects user communities based on their stances toward posts and news sources. We then project each community onto a credibility-bias space and analyze the distributional characteristics of each projected community to identify those that have a high risk of adopting beliefs with low credibility or high bias. This approach also enables the prediction of individual users' susceptibility to low-credibility content based on their community affiliation. Our results show that latent space clusters effectively indicate the credibility and bias levels of their users, with significant variance observed across clusters---a 34% difference in the users' susceptibility to low-credibility content and a 8.3% difference in the users' susceptibility to high political bias.",anonymous,"【使用**立场检测**得到用户嵌入、然后**谱聚类用于社区分析**】[方法概括]

**局限性总结：**  
本研究主要针对基于传播结构的谣言检测器，未探索其他检测范式（如基于内容或用户的方法）。所提出的攻击框架假设可访问传播树中的关键节点，这在现实对抗场景中未必可行。此外，触发器在不同模型架构间的可迁移性需在更多样化条件下进一步验证。",https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/33944,,AAAI,[AI generated] 基于传播的谣言检测器的后门攻击,"[AI generated] Backdoor Attack on Propagation-based Rumor Detectors: Like a sleeper agent in a social network, it lies dormant until triggered to manipulate rumor detection outcomes.

The propagation structure has garnered attention for its ability to capture discriminative information, such as crowd stance, which has led to the development of enhanced detection methods. However, these detectors are vulnerable to attacks that can manipulate results and evade detection, potentially disrupting public order or influencing public opinion. While adversarial attacks on rumor detectors have been studied, the use of backdoor attacks—an evasive and powerful method—remains unexplored due to the challenges in applying them to propagation trees. In this paper, we introduce the first backdoor attack framework against propagation-based rumor detectors, designed to maintain overall detector performance while enabling targeted attacks on specific rumors. We propose an adaptive discrete trigger generator that injects trigger nodes into critical nodes, creating evasive, transferable attacks. Extensive experiments on three real-world rumor datasets demonstrate that our framework effectively undermines the performance of propagation-based rumor detectors and is transferable across different architectures.",anonymous,,true,unread,2026-02-16 02:25:17,false,false,,,6282efd9
